Heterogeneous Satellite Network: GEO and LEO with Shared Spectrum
This scenario considers a downlink heterogeneous satellite network. The network consists of:
One NM-antenna Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite.
One NT-antenna Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite.
Key characteristics:
Both satellites utilize the same frequency spectrum.
The GEO satellite serves M single-antenna GEO ground users (GGUs).
The LEO satellite serves K single-antenna LEO ground users (LGUs).
The expected power of transmitted symbols is normalized: \(\mathbb{E}\{|s_{k}|^{2}\}=1\) and \(\mathbb{E}\{|s_{m}|^{2}\}=1\).
Indexing:
0 denotes the GEO satellite.
m ∈ M = {1, 2, ..., M} denotes the m-th GGU.
k ∈ K = {1, 2, ..., K} denotes the k-th LGU.
The transmit signals are given by:
GEO satellite: \(x_{G}=\sum_{m=1}^{M}w_{m}s_{m}\) (2)
LEO satellite: \(x_{L}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{k}s_{k}\) (3)
Where:
\(w_m\) and \(w_k\) represents the Beamforming vectors for the GEO and LEO satelites respectively.
\(s_m\) and \(s_k\) represents the transmited signals to the users.
Network Heterogeneity:The network combines GEO and LEO satellites, leveraging their distinct orbital characteristics.
Spectrum Sharing:Both satellites operating on the same spectrum introduces potential interference challenges.
User Distribution:Separate user groups are served by each satellite, indicating a geographically or service-oriented division.
Signal Representation:Equations (2) and (3) mathematically represent the transmitted signals as a summation of weighted user symbols.
Beamforming:The presance of the w vectors show the use of beamforming within the satelites transmissions.
Practical Implications:This model is applicable to hybrid satellite communication systems aimed at enhancing coverage and capacity.This highlights the fundamental equations involved in the description of the transmited signals of a mixed GEO/LEO satelite network.

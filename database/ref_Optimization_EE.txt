Energy Efficiency (EE) Model in a Communication System
Energy efficiency (EE) is defined as the ratio of the sum achievable rate to the total power consumption. In this system, the EE at the area is expressed as:
\[EE(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c, c_k\}) = \frac{R(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c, c_k\})}{P_T(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c\})} \quad (17)\]
where \(EE(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c, c_k\})\) is the energy efficiency.
where
\[P_T(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c\}) = \mu \left\| \mathbf{w}^c \right\|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^K \left\| \mathbf{w}_k^p \right\|^2 + P_C \quad (18)\]
Here, \(P_T(\{\mathbf{w}^p, \mathbf{w}^c\})\) is the total power consumption.
With \(\mu \in [1, \infty)\) and \(P_C\) being the power amplifier efficiency factor and the constant power consumption by circuit modules, respectively.
Key Independent Points:
Definition of Energy Efficiency:
EE is the ratio of how much data can be transmitted, to how much power is required to transmit that data.
It is a key metric for evaluating the power efficiency of communication systems.
Total Power Consumption Model (Equation 18):
This model breaks down the total power into three components:
Power used for transmitting common signals (\(\mu \left\| \mathbf{w}^c \right\|^2\)).
Power used for transmitting private signals (\(\sum_{k=1}^K \left\| \mathbf{w}_k^p \right\|^2\)).
Constant power consumption by circuit modules (\(P_C\)).
The factor \(\mu\) reflects the efficiency of the power amplifier for the common signal.
It is assumed that the power amp efficiency of the private streams is 1.
Relationship Between EE and Achievable Rate:
From equation (17), higher achievable rates result in higher energy efficiency, given constant power consumption.
Conversely, higher power consumption results in lower energy efficiency, given a constant achievable rate.
Practical Considerations:
\(P_C\) accounts for the baseline power consumption of the system, which is independent of the transmitted signals.
Optimizing EE involves finding a balance between maximizing the achievable rate and minimizing the total power consumption.
The value of Mu, will greatly effect the overall power consumption of the common streams.

Time-Varying Channel Model: Gauss-Markov Fading
In a time-varying channel model, the statistical characteristics of the communication channel, like Doppler shift, vary rapidly over time. Adapting Jakes' model [35], and assuming the large-scale fading remains constant from equation (9) (which isn't explicitly shown, but referenced), the small-scale fading vector \(\mathbf{g}\) is described by a first-order complex Gauss-Markov process:
\[
\mathbf{g}(t) = \rho \mathbf{g}(t-1) + \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} \mathbf{e} \quad (10)
\]
In equation (10), \(\mathbf{e}\) represents additive complex Gaussian noise, which has the same statistical distribution as \(\mathbf{g}\). The correlation coefficient \(\rho\) is defined by:
\[
\rho = J_0(2 \pi f_d T_s) \quad (11)
\]
Where \(J_0(\cdot)\) signifies the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind, \(T_s\) is the time interval between consecutive samples, and \(f_d\) is the maximum Doppler frequency.
Key Independent Points:
Gauss-Markov Process for Fading:
The channel's small-scale fading is modelled as a first-order complex Gauss-Markov process. This signifies that the current fading condition is directly influenced by the previous fading condition, as well as an added white gaussian noise component.
This type of model allows for the simulation of time correlation within the channel.
Correlation Coefficient and Doppler Effect:
The correlation coefficient \(\rho\) is determined by the Doppler frequency \(f_d\) and the time interval \(T_s\).
This makes clear the impact of the doppler effect on channel correlation, where a higher doppler frequency and or time sample rate, will decrease the correlation between channel samples.
The Zero order Bessel function of the first kind is used to compute this correlation.
Additive Gaussian Noise:
\(\mathbf{e}\) represents the complex Gaussian noise component, which introduces randomness and variability into the fading process.
The noise has the same distribution as the fading vector.
Application:
This model applies to communication scenarios where there is considerable movement between reciever and transmitter, thus creating a rapidly changing channel.

Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) in Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) enables the simultaneous serving of multiple ground users by using spatial separation techniques. The following equations define the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for two different types of ground users.
The SINR at the *m*-th Ground User (GGU) is given by:
\[
\Gamma_m(\{\mathbf{w}_k\}) = \frac{|\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_m|^2}{\sum_{m'=1, m' \neq m}^{M} |\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_{m'}|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_k|^2 + \sigma_a^2} \quad (4)
\]
And the SINR at the *k*-th Ground User (LGU) is given by:
\[
\Gamma_k(\{\mathbf{w}_k\}) = \frac{|\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_k|^2}{\sum_{k'=1, k' \neq k}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_{k'}|^2 + \sum_{m=1}^{M} |\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_m|^2 + \sigma_b^2} \quad (5)
\]
Where:
\(\Gamma_m(\{\mathbf{w}_k\})\) and \(\Gamma_k(\{\mathbf{w}_k\})\) represent the SINR at the *m*-th GGU and *k*-th LGU, respectively.
\(\mathbf{w}_m\) and \(\mathbf{w}_k\) are the beamforming vectors.
\(\mathbf{h}_{G,m}\) represents the channel vector between a transmitter labeled "G" and the *m*-th GGU.
\(\mathbf{h}_{L,k}\) represents the channel vector between a transmitter labeled "L" and the *k*-th LGU.
\(\sigma_a^2\) and \(\sigma_b^2\) denote the Gaussian noise powers at the *m*-th GGU and *k*-th LGU, respectively.
Key Independent Points:
SDMA Functionality:
The equations model a system employing SDMA, which aims to serve multiple users concurrently through spatial separation.
SINR as Performance Metric:
The SINR equations (4) and (5) quantify the quality of the received signal for each user, considering both desired signal power and interference.
Interference Modeling:
The denominators of the equations model interference from other users within the system, demonstrating how interference impacts signal quality.
It shows the cross interference between two sets of users, as well as the interference caused between the users of each set.
Beamforming Implementation:
The presence of beamforming vectors indicates that the system utilizes beamforming to direct signals towards specific users.
Noise Impact:
The Gaussian noise terms account for the inevitable presence of thermal noise in the communication system.
Channel Vectors:
The h vectors are intended to show the channel state information.
General Purpose application:
These equations are to be used when evaluating a system that is utlizing SDMA, in order to determine the SINR that the users will be recieving.

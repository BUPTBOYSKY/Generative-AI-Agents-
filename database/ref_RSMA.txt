Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)
To improve system performance by decomposing signals into common and private parts, Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is employed. In this specific scenario, a 1-layer RSMA scheme is utilized.
The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the *m*-th Ground User is given by:
\[
\Gamma_m(\{\mathbf{w}_k^p, \mathbf{w}^c\}) = \frac{|\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_m|^2}{\sum_{m'=1, m' \neq m}^{M} |\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_{m'}|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,m}^H \mathbf{w}_k^p|^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,m}^H \mathbf{w}_k^c|^2 + \sigma_a^2} \quad (6)
\]
Where:
\(\Gamma_m(\{\mathbf{w}_k^p, \mathbf{w}^c\})\) is the SINR for the *m*-th Ground User.
\(\mathbf{w}_k^p\) and \(\mathbf{w}_k^c\) represent the beamforming vectors associated with the private and common signal streams, respectively.
\(\mathbf{h}_{G,m}\) and \(\mathbf{h}_{L,m}\) are channel vectors.
\(\sigma_a^2\) is the Gaussian noise power.
The corresponding common SINR and private SINR at the *k*-th user are given by:
\[
\Gamma_k^c(\{\mathbf{w}_k^p, \mathbf{w}^c\}) = \frac{|\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_k^c|^2}{\sum_{k'=1, k' \neq k}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_{k'}^c|^2 + \sum_{m=1}^{M} |\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_m|^2 + \sigma_b^2} \quad (7)
\]
\[
\Gamma_k^p(\{\mathbf{w}_k^p\}) = \frac{|\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_k^p|^2}{\sum_{k'=1, k' \neq k}^{K} |\mathbf{h}_{L,k}^H \mathbf{w}_{k'}^p|^2 + \sum_{m=1}^{M} |\mathbf{h}_{G,m}^H \mathbf{w}_m|^2 + \sigma_b^2} \quad (8)
\]
Where:
\(\Gamma_k^c\) and \(\Gamma_k^p\) are the common and private SINR, respectively, for the *k*-th user.
\(\sigma_b^2\) is the Gaussian noise power for those users.
All other variables hold there meaning from before.
Key Independent Points:
RSMA Decomposition:
The core idea is to split signals into common and private streams.
SINR Calculations:
Equations (6), (7), and (8) provide formulas for calculating SINR for different users and signal streams.
Equation 6, displays the SINR for a ground user that is recieving signals that have been affected by both the common, and private streams.
Equation 7, and 8, display the seperate SINR measurements for both the common, and private streams, as they are recived by the users.
Interference Consideration:
The denominators in the SINR equations include interference terms from other users and signal streams.
Beamforming Vectors:
The use of beamforming vectors "w" shows that this system utilizes beam forming to help direct the signals.
Noise Impact:
Gaussian noise (\(\sigma_a^2\), \(\sigma_b^2\)) is accounted for in the SINR calculations.
Practical application:
These equations are to be used when evaluating a system that is utlizing RSMA, in order to determine the SINR that the users will be recieving.

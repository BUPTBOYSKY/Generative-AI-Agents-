Downlink LEO Satellite Communication with MIMO and Beamforming
In homogeneous scenarios involving a downlink Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite and a terrestrial network, consider an \(N_T\)-antenna LEO satellite serving \(K\) single-antenna LEO ground users (LGUs). The expected power of each transmitted symbol \(s_k\) is normalized, represented by \(\mathbb{E}\{|s_k|^2\} = 1\), where \(k\) belongs to the set \(\mathcal{K} = \{1, ..., K\}\). Consequently, the transmit signal, denoted as \(x\), is formulated as:
\[x = \sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k s_k\]
where \(w_k \in \mathbb{C}^{N_T \times 1}\) signifies the beamforming vector associated with the stream \(s_k\).
Key Concepts and Related Information:
LEO Satellite Communication:
LEO satellites offer reduced latency due to their lower orbital altitude, making them suitable for latency-sensitive applications.
The high velocity of LEO satellites necessitates frequent satellite handovers, posing design challenges for communication systems.
LEO satellites have a relatively small coverage footprint, requiring extensive constellations for global coverage.
Downlink Communication:
This refers to the communication link from the satellite to the ground users.
In downlink scenarios, the satellite must simultaneously transmit signals to multiple ground users, necessitating the use of multiple access techniques.
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Technology:
The \(N_T\) antennas on the satellite enable the implementation of MIMO technology.
MIMO enhances channel capacity, increases data transmission rates, and improves communication quality.
Beamforming, a subset of MIMO, concentrates signal energy towards intended users by adjusting antenna array weights, thereby strengthening signal intensity.
Single-Antenna Users:
The \(K\) single-antenna LGUs indicate that each ground user is equipped with only one antenna.
Single-antenna users typically receive weaker signals, requiring the satellite to employ techniques like beamforming for signal enhancement.
Signal Model:
\(\mathbb{E}\{|s_k|^2\} = 1\) represents that the average energy of the transmited signals is normalized to one.
The given linear equation represents that the transmited signal is the sum of all of the users signals with a weight applied to each one.
Beamforming Vector (\(w_k\)):
This complex vector, \(w_k \in \mathbb{C}^{N_T \times 1}\), defines the weights applied to each antenna.
The design of beamforming vectors is crucial for MIMO performance and requires optimization based on channel state information.
Homogeneous Scenarios:
Homogenous scenarios, represent that the devices within the network, have similiar characteristics, for example, that all of the ground users utilize the same kind of reciever.
